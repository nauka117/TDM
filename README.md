# TDM: Learning Few-Step Diffusion Models by Trajectory Distribution Matching
This is the Official Repository of "Learning Few-Step Diffusion Models by Trajectory Distribution Matching", by *Yihong Luo, Tianyang Hu, Jiacheng Sun, Yujun Cai, Jing Tang*.

## Fast Text-to-Video Geneartion

Our proposed TDM can be easily extended to text-to-video.

The above is generated by Cog-VideoX-2B on a single 4090 by around 90s.

At the same time, our TDM can generate 25 videos! 25 times faster without performance degradation!


## 🔥TODO 
- Pre-trained Models will be released soon.
